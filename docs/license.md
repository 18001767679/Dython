**Python#** uses the MIT license `(mit)`, which allows you to do pretty much anything under one condition;

A copyright notice/credit of Python# should be included. If possible, include Python#'s license.

This allows you to do the following:

- Use it in a commercial use.
- Moddify its script.
- Distribute modifications.
- Use Python# privately.

_The creator of Python#, Daniel, may would not be held liable with any software that uses Python#, and modifications of it as well._
