The `multiples()` returns a list of multiples of ___1___ based on a maximum (___2___).

```py
print(multiples(1, 12))
print(multiples(2, 12))
print(multiples(3, 12))
print(multiples(4, 12))
print(multiples(5, 12))
print(multiples(6, 12))
print(multiples(7, 12))
print(multiples(8, 12))
print(multiples(9, 12))
print(multiples(10, 12))
print(multiples(11, 12))
print(multiples(12, 12))
```
