The four functions, `addty()`, `subty()`, `multy()` & `didty()`, returns the sum, difference, product and quotient respectively of all items in a list.

```py
print(addty([5.3, 3.2, 1.5]))
print(subty([69, 5, 30]))
print(multy([42, 3, 0.5]))
print(didty([100, 5, 2]))
```

```
8.5
34.0
63.0
10.0
```

The `join()` joins all of the items in a list as a string and returns the result.

```py
print(join(['My favorite number is ', 36, '.']))
```

```
My favorite number is 36.
```
